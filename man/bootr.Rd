\usage{
bootr(numruns = 1000, model = lm, formula, formula_match = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{numruns}{The number of iterations.}

\item{model}{The statistical model (defaults to "lm").}

\item{formula}{The formula to use for the model.}

\item{formula_match}{An optional matching formula (defaults to "NULL"). The first variable in the formual is used as the treatment.}

\item{cem_cutpoints}{An optional list of cutpoints for variables in the matching formula.}

\item{data}{The dataframe that contains all variables in 'formula' and 'formula_match'.}

\item{predictions}{A list with two dataframes (defaults to "NULL"): "predictions" contains a set of values to produce predictions for;
"contrasts" contains a list of vectors or lists that for which contrasts should be produced.}
